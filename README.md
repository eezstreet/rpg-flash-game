# Untitled RPG Flash Game

Back in 2010 (my Sophomore year of high school) I created this: A fully featured Flash RPG game. It has very primitive graphics and isn't fleshed out completely, but it does have a very rudimentary quest, item, combat, and AI system. With a little bit of love I'm sure this can be turned into a pretty stellar game.

This project is licensed for general use under the MIT license. Feel free to make your own version of it. It's programmed using ActionScript 2.0 and a fairly old version of Flash (CS3, I think).

**Please note: This project is over 10 years old and hasn't been maintained in nearly that long. Don't expect any updates.**
